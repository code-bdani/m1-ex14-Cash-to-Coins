# Cash to Coins

```sh
mkdir -p ~/workspace/javascript/exercises/cash-to-coins && cd $_
echo '<html>
  <body>
    <script src="./cashToCoins.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>' > index.html
touch cashToCoins.js
code .
```

Convert the dollar amount into the coins that make up that dollar amount. The final result is an object with the correct number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

```js
const dollarAmount = 0.10
const piggyBank = {}

// Your magic code here

console.log(piggyBank)
```

That should produce the following output.

```js
{
  quarters: 0,
  dimes: 1,
  nickels: 0,
  pennies: 0
}
```
